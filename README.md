# ResNet-Faster-RCNN
Train py-faster-rcnn with ResNet models

1. Install py-faster-rcnn, prepare the data and try to train any networks (VGG16, ZF) to make sure everything works.
2. Get ResNet-generator to generate train/test prototxt files for ResNet models.
3. Copy the solver.prototxt to ResNet model folder, and modify the solver's first line to the generated train.prototxt (extremely important, don't forget.)
4. Training/Testing and go to sleep, it will take time.


Scripts and networks will come soon.
